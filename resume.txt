Value-add
-	Led 2-man validation team and improved validation efficiency 
The data validation stage was a 40-man-hours process for the application to ingest the updated data-set and to re-validate the test cases.
I conceived the idea to automate most of the manual activities. After my design was approved, I implemented the data import and preparation using VB.NET, VBA (MS-Excel, MS-Access), and automated the validation process using Apache, MySQL and PHP.
This reduced the validation process to 1-man-hr, and improved the application team’s efficiency to work with updated data.
